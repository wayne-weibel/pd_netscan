# Presciprtive Data Coding Challenge

Please write a simple program in Node.js that satisfies the following:
1. Accepts the name of a network interface from the local system as an input. For example, "en0".
2. Pings all IPv4 addresses available for the local network that interface is associated with.
3. Outputs a list of hosts on the local network that are "alive".

Please feel free to use open-source libraries as needed.
